# **AR 3D Clothing Virtual Fitting Room**

## **Overview**
This project is an **AR-based 3D clothing virtual fitting room** that allows users to try on garments digitally using **Kinect-based body tracking**. By integrating **Unity, Blender, and Kinect sensors**, users can experience real-time garment overlay and interactive fitting. 

The system enhances online shopping and digital fashion experiences by providing:
- **Real-time body tracking**
- **Virtual garment overlay**
- **Gesture-based interaction**
- **Color and size customization**

It is developed as part of a **Final Year Project (FYP)**.

## **Important Note About 3D Models**
**Large 3D model files (>50MB) are not included in this repository** due to GitHub file size limitations. These include:
- Tshirt.blend (~115MB)
- Tshirt 1.blend (~95MB) 
- Associated .blend1 backup files

**To get the complete project with all 3D models:**
1. Download these files from [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/your-folder-id)
2. Place them in their respective folders:
   - `Assets/Tshirt.blend`
   - `Assets/Clothes Model/Tshirt 1.blend`
   - `Assets/Clothes Model/Tshirt.blend1`
   - `Assets/Clothes Model/Tshirt 1.blend1`

The repository includes smaller model files (Jacket and Skirt) which are sufficient for demonstrating the basic functionality.

## **System Setup & Environment Configuration**
### **Step 1: Install Unity**
1. Download and install **Unity Hub** from [Unity's official site](https://unity.com).
2. In Unity Hub, go to `Installs` > `Add` and install **Unity LTS version** (recommended for stability).
3. During installation, select:
   - **Windows Build Support**
   - **Android Build Support** (if mobile compatibility is required).

### **Step 2: Setup a New Unity Project**
1. Open Unity Hub, go to `Projects` > `New` > Select `3D Template`.
2. Name the project and set a preferred location.
3. Click `Create`.

### **Step 3: Install Required Packages**
In **Unity Package Manager** (`Window > Package Manager`):
- **Import "Standard Assets"** for basic UI/controls.
- **Import Kinect SDK** from Microsoft.

### **Step 4: Integrate Kinect Sensor**
1. **Download Kinect SDK** from [Microsoft's site](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect).
2. **Import Kinect Package** into Unity (`Assets > Import Package > Custom Package`).
3. **Initialize Kinect Sensor** in `KinectManager.cs`:
   ```csharp
   void Start() {
       KinectSensor sensor = KinectSensor.GetDefault();
       sensor.Open();
   }
   ```

### **Step 5: Set Up 3D Models in Blender**
1. **Download Blender** from [Blender's site](https://www.blender.org).
2. Import 3D clothing models or create them from scratch.
3. Rig the garments using **armature bones**:
   - Select Garment > `Shift + A` > `Add Armature`.
   - Parent to bones using `Ctrl + P` > `Armature Deform` > `With Automatic Weights`.
4. **Export the model** in `.FBX` format and import it into Unity.

### **Step 6: Gesture Controls Integration**
1. Enable `SwipeGestureDetector` for detecting **swipe gestures** to change colors.
2. Map gestures to specific actions:
   ```csharp
   if (SwipeGestureDetector.DetectSwipe()) {
       ChangeGarmentColor();
   }
   ```

### **Step 7: UI & Interaction**
- Use **Canvas & Panels** in Unity for interface elements.
- Use **Graphic Raycaster** for UI interactions.

2. Connect **Kinect Sensor** to your PC.
3. Press `Play` to test in the **Unity Editor**.

### **Building as an Executable**
1. Go to `File > Build Settings`.
2. Select **Windows** as the platform.
3. Click **Build and Run**.
